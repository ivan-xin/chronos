## Proposal Overview

### VLC & VRF Proposal
Randomness serves a vital role in nearly every aspect of current society，the idea is to intergrate the ablility of logical clocks into random generator. To generate verifiable, fair random numbers, the proposal integrates VRF.


### Proposal Details
We hope to create a new Random number generation scheme in a completely decentralized network environment，utilizing the eventual consistency capability of Hetu logical clocks, and integrate VRF that generates an output that can be cryptographically verified as random，without the need for any trusted third parties or consensus algorithms.
